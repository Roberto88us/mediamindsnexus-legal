# Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 2025-09-22  
**Provider:** Media Minds Nexus LLC (“**Provider**,” “**we**,” “**us**,” “**our**”)  
**Service:** Media Mind QBO Invoicing Automation for QuickBooks Online (the “**Service**”)

We respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.

---

## 1) Scope
This Policy applies to personal information processed when you use the Service, our websites/pages that host this Policy, and when you communicate with us (email/support). It does **not** cover third-party services we don’t control (e.g., Intuit QuickBooks Online (“**QBO**”) or **n8n**). Those services are governed by their own terms and privacy policies.

## 2) Information We Collect
We collect and process information in the following categories:

- **Account & Contact Data:** name, company, role/title, email address, phone number, business address.
- **Customer & Transaction Data (from your systems):** customer records (e.g., names, emails, shipping/billing addresses, phone numbers), item details/SKUs, quotes/estimates, invoices, payments metadata (amounts, dates, non-card details).
- **QBO/N8n Integration Data:** OAuth client/app identifiers, access/refresh tokens or token references, realm/company IDs, webhook events, API request/response metadata (timestamps, status, object IDs).
- **Usage & Technical Data:** logs, diagnostic information, workflow run IDs, IP address, device/browser type, pages or endpoints accessed, timestamps, error traces.
- **Support Content:** messages, attachments, and any other information you voluntarily provide when you contact us.

> **No full payment card data.** We do **not** collect or store card PANs or ACH account numbers. Payments are processed by Intuit (QBO Payments) under their PCI/financial controls.

## 3) Sources of Information
- Directly from you (forms, emails, support).
- From your connected services and automation workflows (e.g., QBO, n8n executions).
- Automatically via logs and analytics necessary to operate and secure the Service.

## 4) How We Use Information
We use information to:
- Provide, operate, and improve the Service and its integrations.
- Authenticate and maintain secure connections (e.g., OAuth with Intuit).
- Automate tasks you configure (e.g., create customers/items/invoices, send invoices, fetch invoice links).
- Provide support, detect/prevent abuse, and debug issues.
- Comply with legal obligations and enforce agreements.

Where required by law, we rely on one or more legal bases (performance of contract; legitimate interests in providing/maintaining the Service; compliance with legal obligations; consent where applicable).

## 5) Sharing & Disclosures
We share information only as necessary:
- **With Processors/Service Providers:** e.g., hosting, logging, error monitoring, secure key vault/secret storage, CI/CD, and email. They are bound by confidentiality and data processing terms.
- **With Intuit (QBO) and n8n:** to perform the automations you configure (e.g., creating invoices, retrieving invoice links, sending invoice emails).
- **For Legal/Compliance:** to comply with law, enforce terms, or protect rights, safety, and security.
- **Business Transfers:** in the event of a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, subject to continued protection of personal information.

We do **not** sell personal information. We do not share it for cross-context behavioral advertising.

## 6) International Transfers
We may process information in the United States and other locations where we or our providers operate. When transferring data internationally, we use appropriate safeguards consistent with applicable law.

## 7) Data Security
We employ administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect personal information, including:
- Encryption in transit (TLS) and at rest (where applicable).
- Restricted access to OAuth credentials and tokens.
- Environment isolation and least-privilege access.
- Logging and monitoring for anomalous activity.

No system is 100% secure; you are responsible for securing your own systems and access credentials.

## 8) Data Retention
We retain information for as long as necessary to:
- Provide the Service and complete workflows you configure,
- Comply with legal obligations and enforce agreements,
- Resolve disputes and maintain security/audit logs.

**Access tokens** and cached objects are kept only as long as needed for workflow operation, and are deleted/revoked upon disconnection or termination. Upon termination of the Service, we delete tokens and data we store within **30 days**, unless longer retention is legally required or you request otherwise.

## 9) Your Choices & Rights
Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or receive a copy of your personal information, and to object to or restrict certain processing.

- **Access/Deletion/Correction Requests:** Email **legal@mediamindsnexus.com** with “Privacy Request” in the subject. We will verify your identity and respond as required by law.
- **Opt-Out of Non-Essential Emails:** Use unsubscribe links or contact us.
- **Disconnect Integrations:** You can revoke access to the Service in your Intuit developer dashboard/QBO settings and in n8n.

If you are located in the EEA/UK or in a jurisdiction with specific privacy laws (e.g., GDPR/UK GDPR/CPRA), we will honor applicable rights and disclosures upon request.

## 10) Children’s Privacy
The Service is intended for business use and is not directed to children under 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 11) Cookies & Similar Technologies
We may use strictly necessary cookies or similar technologies (or rely on our hosting/platform providers) to keep sessions secure and ensure the Service functions. Analytics, if used, will be configured in a privacy-conscious manner or will require your consent where required by law.

## 12) Changes to this Policy
We may update this Policy from time to time. We will post the new version with an updated **Effective date** and highlight material changes for at least 30 days.
